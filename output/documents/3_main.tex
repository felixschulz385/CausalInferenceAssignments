\section*{Instrumental Variables}

\subsection*{Question 1}

\paragraph*{(a)}
% How could what you observe affect the intra-household division of (market) labour supply, domestic chores and childcare?

\input{output/tables/3_avg_age}

\input{output/tables/3_iv_ols_weeksm}

\paragraph*{(d)}
% Compare methods, 2SLS estimates, first stages.

Weirdly enough, all estimates are not significant?? is this what the exercise asks us to do?

\paragraph*{(e)}
% Compare the OLS estimate to the 2SLS you got before and also the respective standard errors. What do you conclude? Which one would you use for inference?

\subsection*{Question 2}

\paragraph*{(a)}

\input{output/tables/3_children_age_group}

\paragraph*{(b)}
% Why would you control specifically for these variables? Are these control variables sufficient to alleviate potential endogeneity concerns? Why yes or why not? 

\paragraph*{(c)}
% Compare your results to the OLS estimates and comment. 

\input{output/tables/3_iv_ols_weeksm}

\paragraph*{(d)}
% Why might the sample restrictions you imposed (women below the median age) be problematic for the 2SLS approach? 

\section*{Question 3}

\paragraph*{(a)}
% (Task description)
% Independent of the instrument used, Angrist and Evans (1998) find no economically and statistically
% significant effect on male labour supply. Check the employment rates in AngristEvans1980_reduced.RData
% for men and women, and how common part-time work is among employed men and women.
% Compare the results with the rates for Switzerland outlined above.
% Based on that, discuss how you would expect the effect of fertility on male labour supply
% in Switzerland today to differ from those in Angrist and Evans (1998).

\paragraph*{(b)}
% (Task description)
% Discuss how you would use a 2SLS approach to estimate the effect of fertility
% on labour supply in Switzerland today.

\paragraph*{(c)}
% (Task description)
% Discuss how you would modify the sample restrictions that we imposed
% in the IV lab session on the data if we were to use recent data from Switzerland.

\subsection*{Question 4 (PhD Only)}

\paragraph*{(a)}
% (Task description)
% Which test can be performed to test for the exogeneity of the instruments in a parametric IV?
% Explain the logic behind it, and clearly explain what hypothesis we can test.

\paragraph*{(b)}
% (Task description)
% Under which assumptions will the test be informative about instrument validity?

\section*{Regression Discontinuity Design}

\subsection*{Question 6}

\paragraph*{(a)}
% (Task description)
% In addition to data from the 2000 population census,
% the author uses information on outcomes in 1990, which is before the assignment to the treatment.
% What does he use it for and why is it in support of the identification strategy?

\paragraph*{(b)}
% (Task description)
% The author determines the optimal bandwidth using the algorithm developed by
% Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012).
% Briefly explain why it yields a smaller optimal bandwidth for women.

\paragraph*{(c)}
% (Task description)
% For women, the author proposes and tests a mechanism that can explain the positive RD estimate
% (despite a negative raw correlation).
% Explain this mechanism and comment on the test procedures.
